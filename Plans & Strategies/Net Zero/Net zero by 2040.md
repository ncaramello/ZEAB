## Introduction

Brookline has set an ambitious goal: achieve **netâ€‘zero greenhouseâ€‘gas (GHG) emissions byÂ 2040**. Reaching net zero means reducing the town's carbon footprint as much as possible and balancing any remaining emissions with carbon removal or sequestration. Because no single solution can eliminate every emission source, Brookline is considering multiple **pathways** that blend building electrification, clean electricity, transportation changes and carbon offsets. Each pathway reflects a different mix of technology and behavioural change and has different implications for land use, cost and community engagement.

The sections below summarise Brookline's GHG baseline, outline four potential pathways to net zero, and quantify the offsets each pathway would require. Detailed examples show what the offsets mean in concrete terms---how many acres of forest, how many trees, or how many megawatts (MW) of new solar or wind farms would be needed. An appendix compares offsets to renewable energy projects to illustrate why offsets should supplement, not replace, direct emission reductions.

## Brookline greenhouseâ€‘gas baseline

The town of Brookline conducted a comprehensive greenhouseâ€‘gas (GHG) inventory to support its Climate Action and Resiliency Plan (CARP). The communityâ€‘wide inventory found that Brookline emitted **295â€¯,456Â metricâ€¯tonnes of COâ‚‚â€‘equivalent (tCOâ‚‚e)** in the baseline year. Natural gas combustion in homes and businesses was the largest source (39Â %), followed by transportation (31Â %), gridâ€‘supplied electricity (23Â %), fugitive emissions (5Â %), solid waste (1Â %) and water/wastewater treatment (negligible). Municipal operations such as buildings, streetlights, vehicle fleets and employee commuting added another **9â€¯,832Â tCOâ‚‚e**, bringing the **combined baseline to \~305â€¯,288Â tCOâ‚‚e**.

The chart below illustrates the communityâ€‘wide emissions by sector. Natural gas and transportation dominate Brookline's carbon footprint, highlighting the need to tackle building energy use and vehicle fuel. Municipal emissions (not shown here) are relatively small but can serve as a testbed for leading by example.

## The role and limitations of carbon offsets

Offsets can play an important role in reaching net zero, but their value is limited and they should not be seen as a substitute for reducing emissions at source. Experts note that offsets provide a stopâ€‘gap that allows time for decarbonization, yet they cannot deliver a durable solution on their own[\[1\]](https://netzeroclimate.org/policies-for-net-zero/net-zero-principles/#:~:text=Short,lived%20storage%20begins%20now)[\[2\]](https://www.3blmedia.com/news/decarbonization-series-part-3-pros-and-cons-carbon-offsets#:~:text=that%20your%20organization%20views%20the,term%20strategies). Buildings and vehicles must still convert to clean energy; offsets cannot compensate for continued fossilâ€‘fuel use forever.

Overâ€‘reliance on offsets also risks obscuring low ambition. Research warns that offsetting can create a false impression that polluting activities can continue without harming the climate, effectively providing an excuse for avoiding genuine emission reductions[\[3\]](https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2023/07/06/does-carbon-offsetting-do-more-harm-than-good/#:~:text=One%20should%20not%20make%20the,It%20can%20also%20lead%20to)[\[4\]](https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2023/07/06/does-carbon-offsetting-do-more-harm-than-good/#:~:text=So%2C%20is%20offsetting%20doing%20more,licence%20for%20business%20as%20usual). The UK's Committee on Climate Change stresses that most sectors---including buildings and power stations---must reduce emissions close to zero without offsetting, reserving offsets only for sectors that are very hard to decarbonise[\[5\]](https://www.netzerocarbonguide.co.uk/guide/early-decisions/what-about-carbon-offsetting#:~:text=Carbon%20offsetting%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20long,shipping%20and%20agriculture%3B%20not%20buildings).

There is also a **finite supply of offset projects**. Land available for forestry and other carbon sequestration is limited: offsetting all global emissions is impossible because there simply is not enough land[\[6\]](https://eciu.net/analysis/briefings/economy-jobs/offsetting-and-carbon-markets#:~:text=Offsetting%20all%20global%20emissions%20is,drive%20to%20reach%20%E2%80%98true%20zero%E2%80%99). Early offsetting plans by just two airlines would have consumed **12Â %** of the world's available offsets[\[7\]](https://eciu.net/analysis/briefings/economy-jobs/offsetting-and-carbon-markets#:~:text=But%20even%20early%20offsetting%20plans,of%20all%20available%20offsets). Largeâ€‘scale offset schemes compete with food production and nature, and can lead to landâ€‘rights conflicts[\[8\]](https://eciu.net/analysis/briefings/economy-jobs/offsetting-and-carbon-markets#:~:text=Land%20is%20a%20finite%20resource). If every town relied on offsets instead of decarbonising, the global offset market would be overwhelmed and still fall short of the emission reductions needed.

For these reasons, Brookline should view offsets as a **last resort** after maximising energy efficiency, building electrification, renewable energy procurement and mobility shifts. Offsets can neutralise residual emissions, but they **cannot replace** the hard work of reducing emissions and decarbonising the energy supply[\[9\]](https://www.netzerocarbonguide.co.uk/guide/early-decisions/what-about-carbon-offsetting#:~:text=Relying%20on%20offsetting%20does%20not,times%20larger%20than%20the%20UK)[\[10\]](https://www.netzerocarbonguide.co.uk/guide/early-decisions/what-about-carbon-offsetting#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20substitute%20for,to%20act%20as%20a%20carbon).

## PathwayÂ 1Â -- Electrificationâ€‘First

**Vision:** Rapidly electrify buildings and vehicles so that only a small fraction of emissions remains to be offset.

**Buildings and infrastructure.** ByÂ 2040, **90--95Â %** of residences and businesses retrofit or build with electric heatâ€‘pump space and water heating, induction cooking and highâ€‘efficiency envelopes. New construction is fossilâ€‘free by the earlyÂ 2030s and municipal facilities electrify even sooner.

**Electricity supply.** Brookline purchases or contracts for **100Â % renewable electricity** through community choice aggregation and encourages rooftop and community solar. Grid upgrades support the additional electric load.

**Transportation.** **80--90Â %** of vehicles are electric, complemented by expanded public transit and walking/cycling infrastructure. Municipal and school fleets convert to EVs.

**Offsets and concrete examples.** Even with deep electrification, **3--5Â %** of baseline emissions (â‰ˆ9,000--15,000Â tCOâ‚‚e) remain from legacy gas use, specialized vehicles and refrigerant losses. To reach net zero, Brookline would need to sequester or displace these emissions by:

-   **Forests or trees:** Plant or preserve **9,000--15,000Â acres** of forest or **150,000--250,000 urban trees**. Each acre of U.S. forest sequesters about 1Â tCOâ‚‚ per year and each urban tree about 0.06Â tCOâ‚‚[\[11\]](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20carbon%20dioxide,%28EPA%202024a%3B%20EIA%202023b%29.1)[\[12\]](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#:~:text=Number%20of%20urban%20tree%20seedlings,grown%20for%2010%20years).
-   **New solar farms:** Build **9--16Â MW** of **new** solar capacity. A utilityâ€‘scale solar farm displacing naturalâ€‘gas power saves about **980Â tCOâ‚‚ per MW per year** (20Â MW offsetting \~19,600Â tCOâ‚‚[\[13\]](https://www.pivotenergy.net/blog/solar-farm-land-requirements#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20a%20solar,five%20acres%20of%20buildable%20land)[\[14\]](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/10/26/solar-panels-reduce-co2-emissions-more-per-acre-than-trees-and-much-more-than-corn-ethanol/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20the,208%20to%20236%20times%20more)). Existing solar projects cannot be claimed as offsets; Brookline would need to develop new solar projects on roughly **45--80Â acres** of land (â‰ˆ5Â acres per MW[\[13\]](https://www.pivotenergy.net/blog/solar-farm-land-requirements#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20a%20solar,five%20acres%20of%20buildable%20land)).
-   **New wind farms:** Install **4--8Â MW** of wind turbines (roughly two to four 2â€‘MW turbines). A typical **2Â MW wind turbine** avoids **4,000--4,500Â tCOâ‚‚** annually[\[15\]](https://offshorewindfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02_SIOW_Climate-Change_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=average%20of%207%20tons%20of,Power%20generated%20by); thus 1Â MW avoids 2,000--2,250Â tCOâ‚‚.

These offsets are modest relative to Brookline's overall emissions and could be achieved through local or regional projects. However, they still require **new** investments---planting trees, constructing solar arrays or erecting wind turbines---rather than purchasing credits from existing projects.

## PathwayÂ 2Â -- Balanced ElectrificationÂ +Â Offsets

**Vision:** Balance widespread electrification with a meaningful but manageable offset program for harderâ€‘toâ€‘retrofit buildings and vehicles.

**Buildings and infrastructure.** **75--85Â %** of buildings convert to electric heat pumps. Older multifamily buildings or historic homes use district geothermal systems or shared loops for partial decarbonization.

**Electricity supply.** Brookline procures **80--90Â % renewable electricity**. Local solar on municipal roofs and parking lots generates a significant share and provides renewableâ€‘energy credits to fund offsets.

**Transportation.** **65--75Â %** of vehicles are electric. Mode shifts toward buses, trains and eâ€‘bikes reduce vehicle miles travelled.

**Offsets and concrete examples.** Residual emissions under this scenario equal **10--15Â %** of the baseline (â‰ˆ30,000--46,000Â tCOâ‚‚e). Brookline would need to offset these through combinations such as:

-   **Forests or trees:** Preserve **30,000--46,000Â acres** of forest or plant **510,000--760,000 trees**.
-   **New solar farms:** Develop **31--47Â MW** of new solar capacity (â‰ˆ160--235Â acres) to displace fossilâ€‘fuel generation. This capacity would avoid the same emissions that need offsetting.
-   **New wind farms:** Install **14--23Â MW** of new wind capacity (about seven to eleven 2â€‘MW turbines), which would avoid \~2,000--2,250Â tCOâ‚‚ per MW[\[15\]](https://offshorewindfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02_SIOW_Climate-Change_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=average%20of%207%20tons%20of,Power%20generated%20by).

These offsets become a **meaningful piece** of the plan---erasing roughly one in every seven tons of emissions---but still rely on **new projects**. Purchasing renewableâ€‘energy credits from existing facilities would not count toward Brookline's offsets because those projects already displace emissions.

## PathwayÂ 3Â -- Aggressive Mobility Shift

**Vision:** Transform transportation habits and urban design to reduce car dependence, while electrifying most remaining buildings and vehicles.

**Buildings and infrastructure.** **70--80Â %** of residences and businesses electrify; older buildings remain partially on fossil fuels.

**Transportation.** Major investments in **public transit**, bike lanes and pedestrianâ€‘first zoning lead to **40--50Â % of all trips** by transit, biking or walking. Car ownership drops and only **50--65Â %** of vehicles are electric, but there are far fewer vehicles overall.

**Electricity supply.** Brookline contracts for **100Â % renewable electricity** through regional grid purchases.

**Offsets and concrete examples.** Even with fewer cars and improved land use, **10--20Â %** of baseline emissions (â‰ˆ30,000--61,000Â tCOâ‚‚e) remain. Offsetting them could involve:

-   **Forests or trees:** Conserve **30,000--61,000Â acres** of forest or plant **510,000--1,017,000 trees**.
-   **New solar farms:** Build **31--62Â MW** of new solar capacity (â‰ˆ155--310Â acres), providing local clean power and offsets.
-   **New wind farms:** Add **14--31Â MW** of new wind capacity (roughly seven to fifteen 2â€‘MW turbines).

**Offset strategies** would prioritise local green infrastructure (green roofs, bioswales, biochar) and regional soilâ€‘carbon projects on farms. If these are insufficient, Brookline would still need to invest in **new** renewable projects---transit electrification or renewable generation---to claim offsets.

## PathwayÂ 4Â -- Offsetâ€‘Heavy

**Vision:** Slow electrification and limited behaviour change mean that offsets carry a large share of the load.

**Buildings and infrastructure.** Only **50--65Â %** of buildings electrify; many homes and businesses continue burning natural gas or oil.

**Transportation.** **45--60Â %** of vehicles are electric; car dependence remains high and public transit improvements are modest.

**Electricity supply.** Brookline procures **70--80Â % renewable electricity** but still imports fossilâ€‘fuelled power during peak periods.

**Offsets and concrete examples.** Because residual emissions remain large, Brookline must offset **25--40Â %** of the baseline---**about 76,000--122,000Â tCOâ‚‚e**. Achieving this would require major new sequestration or renewable projects, such as:

-   **Forests or trees:** Secure **76,000--122,000Â acres** of forest or plant **1.3--2.0Â million trees**, an area and number far beyond Brookline's borders.
-   **New solar farms:** Construct **78--125Â MW** of new solar capacity (â‰ˆ390--625Â acres). These solar farms would need to be **net new projects** delivering power that displaces fossilâ€‘fuel generation; buying into existing farms would not count as offsets because their emissions reductions are already accounted for.
-   **New wind farms:** Install **34--61Â MW** of wind turbines (about seventeen to thirty one 2â€‘MW turbines). Like solar, these wind farms must be additional to existing projects to generate valid offsets[\[15\]](https://offshorewindfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02_SIOW_Climate-Change_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=average%20of%207%20tons%20of,Power%20generated%20by).

Relying on offsets at this scale is **politically and financially risky**. Largeâ€‘scale reforestation may not be feasible within Massachusetts, and purchasing wind or solar projects in other regions could face legal or community resistance. Moreover, future offset prices are uncertain. This pathway illustrates the challenge of substituting offsets for direct emission reductions.

## Summary of offset requirements

## Offsets required by scenario

The table below summarises residual emissions and the approximate scale of offsets required for each pathway. It shows the range of emissions remaining after electrification and mobility shifts (as a percentage of the 305,288Â tCOâ‚‚e baseline) and converts those emissions into equivalent forest area, number of trees, and new solar or wind capacity. The assumptions are: **1Â tCOâ‚‚ per acre of forest per year**, **0.06Â tCOâ‚‚ per urban tree per year**[\[11\]](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20carbon%20dioxide,%28EPA%202024a%3B%20EIA%202023b%29.1)[\[12\]](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#:~:text=Number%20of%20urban%20tree%20seedlings,grown%20for%2010%20years), **980Â tCOâ‚‚ per MW of solar**[\[13\]](https://www.pivotenergy.net/blog/solar-farm-land-requirements#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20a%20solar,five%20acres%20of%20buildable%20land)[\[14\]](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/10/26/solar-panels-reduce-co2-emissions-more-per-acre-than-trees-and-much-more-than-corn-ethanol/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20the,208%20to%20236%20times%20more) and **2,000--2,250Â tCOâ‚‚ per MW of wind**[\[15\]](https://offshorewindfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02_SIOW_Climate-Change_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=average%20of%207%20tons%20of,Power%20generated%20by).

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even under the electrificationâ€‘first pathway, Brookline would need to plant around **150,000--250,000 trees**, preserve **9,000--15,000Â acres** of forest, or build **9--16Â MW of new solar** to offset residual emissions. The offsetâ€‘heavy pathway would require **1--2Â million trees** or **78--125Â MW of new solar**---projects far larger than anything Brookline has today. These numbers underscore why **offsets cannot replace emission cuts**, especially if Brookline must rely on projects outside its borders.

## Cost estimates for offsets

Offsets are not free. Developing new forests, solar farms or wind farms requires substantial capital. TableÂ 2 translates the offset requirements from each pathway into **ballpark cost ranges** using published cost estimates. These figures are illustrative but highlight the order of magnitude of investment needed. Key assumptions include:

-   **Reforestation cost:** A national study of U.S. reforestation programs found that median costs---including seedlings, site preparation and postâ€‘planting care---average **\$1,262 per hectare** (â‰ˆ\$511 per acre)[\[16\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349034490_Challenges_to_the_Reforestation_Pipeline_in_the_United_States#:~:text=median%20reforestation%20costs%20to%20be,788%2C%20%241%2C058%2C%20and%20%242%2C098%20per). Costs vary by region but this figure provides a reasonable baseline.
-   **Solar farm cost:** Utilityâ€‘scale solar farms cost roughly **\$0.98--\$1.56 per watt** (\$980,000--\$1,560,000 per MW) depending on project scale[\[17\]](https://www.solarreviews.com/blog/what-is-a-solar-farm-do-i-need-one#:~:text=,not%20including%20land%20acquisition%20costs)[\[18\]](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_pv#:~:text=in%202022%20is%20based%20on,34). The lower end reflects 2025 projections from industry sources; the upper end reflects 2023 NREL estimates.
-   **Wind farm cost:** Landâ€‘based wind turbines cost around **\$1.37 million per MW**; installed costs have declined dramatically from \$4.8Â million per MW in the 1980s to \$1.37Â million per MW in 2022[\[19\]](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=by%2071,26). A typical 2â€‘MW turbine therefore costs about \$2.6--\$4Â million[\[20\]](https://weatherguardwind.com/how-much-does-wind-turbine-cost-worth-it/#:~:text=,producing%20capacity).

These cost ranges do **not** include land acquisition, permitting, transmission upgrades or longâ€‘term maintenance, all of which would add significantly to the total. They also assume that Brookline builds **new** renewable energy projects rather than purchasing stakes in existing facilities, because only new projects create additional emission reductions. Additional estimates for **land lease costs** and **longâ€‘term tree maintenance** are provided in **AppendixÂ D**. The **reforestation costs** in TableÂ 2 are calculated using a national median of **\$511 per acre**[\[16\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349034490_Challenges_to_the_Reforestation_Pipeline_in_the_United_States#:~:text=median%20reforestation%20costs%20to%20be,788%2C%20%241%2C058%2C%20and%20%242%2C098%20per), reflecting lowâ€‘cost rural planting. The numbers show that even modest reliance on offsets could require **tens of millions of dollars** of investment, while an offsetâ€‘heavy pathway could demand **over one hundred million dollars** for new solar or wind projects alone. See **AppendixÂ E** for a detailed discussion of tree and reforestation cost assumptions.

### Why are the MW values different for solar and wind?

A common question is why the **megawatts (MW) of solar and wind capacity differ** in the offset tables. One MW of installed capacity does not generate the same amount of electricity across technologies because of differences in **capacity factor**, the ratio of actual energy produced to the maximum possible energy. Utilityâ€‘scale solar facilities typically have capacity factors around **25Â %** in the United States, whereas onshore wind farms average about **35Â %**[\[21\]](https://visualizingenergy.org/what-are-capacity-factors-and-why-are-they-important/#:~:text=Wind%20%2835,energy%20vary%20dramatically%2C%20and%20significant). In other words, a wind turbine of a given size operates at or near its rated power more often than a solar array, which only produces at its rated capacity when the sun is shining. The offset calculations therefore use **â‰ˆ980Â tCOâ‚‚ per MW** for solar (based on 30Â % capacity factor) and **â‰ˆ2,000Â tCOâ‚‚ per MW** for wind (reflecting higher capacity factor and empirical estimates of emissions avoided per turbine[\[15\]](https://offshorewindfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02_SIOW_Climate-Change_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=average%20of%207%20tons%20of,Power%20generated%20by)). Because each MW of wind displaces roughly twice as much carbon as a MW of solar, fewer wind MW are required to offset the same emissions. This disparity is not an error but reflects real differences in energy output.[\[21\]](https://visualizingenergy.org/what-are-capacity-factors-and-why-are-they-important/#:~:text=Wind%20%2835,energy%20vary%20dramatically%2C%20and%20significant)

## AppendixÂ AÂ -- Offsets and landâ€‘use comparison

Offsets often appear easier on paper than in practice. The bar chart below compares the **midâ€‘point** of residual emissions (and thus required offsets) for each pathway. Even moderate reliance on offsets in the balanced and mobility pathways translates into **tens of thousands of acres of forest** or **hundreds of thousands of trees**. The offsetâ€‘heavy scenario dwarfs local land availability and would require projects far beyond Brookline's borders.

![Comparison of offset requirements across scenarios](media/image2.png){width="5.833333333333333in" height="3.6458333333333335in"}

A further comparison underscores the scale of offsets versus renewable energy. A **20Â MW solar farm**---which powers roughly 3,460 homes and avoids about **19,600Â tCOâ‚‚** per year---requires about **100Â acres**[\[13\]](https://www.pivotenergy.net/blog/solar-farm-land-requirements#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20a%20solar,five%20acres%20of%20buildable%20land). To offset the same amount of emissions through forests, Brookline would need **nearly 20,000 acres of trees**[\[11\]](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20carbon%20dioxide,%28EPA%202024a%3B%20EIA%202023b%29.1)---almost two hundred times the land area. This stark contrast highlights why offsets should be treated as a **last resort** once all feasible emission reductions have been achieved.

## AppendixÂ BÂ -- Calculation methodology

This section explains how the numbers in the tables were derived. The goal is to provide transparency around the assumptions and conversions used in this report.

### Baseline emissions and residual fractions

-   **Baseline emissions:** Brookline's combined community and municipal GHG inventory totals **305,288Â tCOâ‚‚e**. This value forms the starting point for all offset calculations.
-   **Residual fraction:** Each pathway assumes a range of emissions that remain after electrification and behavioural changes. For example, the electrificationâ€‘first pathway leaves **3--5Â %** of the baseline (0.03--0.05 Ã— 305,288Â tCOâ‚‚e â‰ˆ 9,159--15,264Â tCOâ‚‚e). Similar multipliers (10--15Â %, 10--20Â %, 25--40Â %) are applied for the other pathways.

### Converting emissions to offsets

1.  **Forest area (acres):** The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that **one acre of forest sequesters approximately 1Â tCOâ‚‚ per year**[\[11\]](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20carbon%20dioxide,%28EPA%202024a%3B%20EIA%202023b%29.1). Thus, forest area (acres) = residual emissions (tCOâ‚‚e).
2.  **Urban trees:** A typical urban tree sequesters about **0.06Â tCOâ‚‚ per year**[\[12\]](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#:~:text=Number%20of%20urban%20tree%20seedlings,grown%20for%2010%20years). The number of trees required = residual emissions Ã· 0.06. For example, 10,000Â tCOâ‚‚ Ã· 0.06 â‰ˆ 166,667 trees.
3.  **New solar capacity:** A utilityâ€‘scale solar farm with a **30Â % capacity factor** produces 0.30Â Ã—Â 8,760Â hours = 2,628Â MWh per MW of installed capacity. Using the national grid emission factor of **823.1Â lbÂ COâ‚‚ per MWh** (â‰ˆ0.373Â tCOâ‚‚/MWh)[\[11\]](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20carbon%20dioxide,%28EPA%202024a%3B%20EIA%202023b%29.1), each MW of new solar avoids **â‰ˆ980Â tCOâ‚‚ per year** (2,628Â MWh Ã— 0.373Â tCOâ‚‚/MWh). Solar capacity (MW) = residual emissions Ã· 980.
4.  **New wind capacity:** Onshore wind turbines operate at a **35Â % capacity factor**, generating 0.35 Ã— 8,760Â hours = 3,066Â MWh per MW. At the same emission factor (0.373Â tCOâ‚‚/MWh), each MW of wind avoids **â‰ˆ1,144Â tCOâ‚‚ per year**. Alternatively, industry literature notes that a **2Â MW wind turbine** avoids **4,000--4,500Â tCOâ‚‚ annually**[\[15\]](https://offshorewindfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02_SIOW_Climate-Change_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=average%20of%207%20tons%20of,Power%20generated%20by), or **2,000--2,250Â tCOâ‚‚ per MW**. To remain conservative, the tables use **2,000Â tCOâ‚‚ per MW**. Wind capacity (MW) = residual emissions Ã· 2,000.

### Cost calculations

1.  **Reforestation cost:** Median reforestation expenses---including seedlings, site preparation and maintenance---average **\$1,262 per hectare** (â‰ˆ\$511 per acre)[\[16\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349034490_Challenges_to_the_Reforestation_Pipeline_in_the_United_States#:~:text=median%20reforestation%20costs%20to%20be,788%2C%20%241%2C058%2C%20and%20%242%2C098%20per). Reforestation cost = forest area (acres) Ã— \$511.
2.  **Solar cost:** Utilityâ€‘scale solar projects cost **\$0.98--\$1.56 per watt** (â‰ˆ\$980,000--\$1,560,000 per MW) depending on project scale[\[17\]](https://www.solarreviews.com/blog/what-is-a-solar-farm-do-i-need-one#:~:text=,not%20including%20land%20acquisition%20costs)[\[18\]](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_pv#:~:text=in%202022%20is%20based%20on,34). To simplify the ranges in TableÂ 2, an average of **\$1Â million per MW** is used. Solar cost = solar capacity (MW) Ã— \$1Â million.
3.  **Wind cost:** Landâ€‘based wind projects cost around **\$1.37Â million per MW**[\[19\]](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=by%2071,26). Wind cost = wind capacity (MW) Ã— \$1.37Â million.
4.  **Treeâ€‘planting cost:** Costs per tree vary widely. Rural planting programmes may cost **\$92 per acre**, which equates to roughly **\$0.21 per tree** at 435 seedlings per acre[\[22\]](https://www.uaex.uada.edu/media-resources/news/2022/february2022/02-18-2022-ark-sustaining-forests.aspx#:~:text=Pelkki%20says%20the%20cost%20of,foot%20spacing.%20He%20said%2C%20%22That). Urban streetâ€‘tree programmes can cost **\$1,200--\$3,300 per tree**[\[23\]](https://forestforall.nyc/costs-city-plant-tree-why/#:~:text=costly,according%20to%20the%20Parks%20Department). In TableÂ 2, we illustrate the cost of treeâ€‘based offsets using a midâ€‘range estimate of **\$1,500 per tree**.

### Example: 20Â MW solar farm calculation

To illustrate the scale of renewable offsets, consider a **20Â MW solar farm**:

-   **Electricity generated:** 20Â MW Ã— 0.30 Ã— 8,760Â hours = **52,560Â MWh per year**.
-   **Emissions avoided:** 52,560Â MWh Ã— 0.373Â tCOâ‚‚/MWh â‰ˆ **19,600Â tCOâ‚‚ per year**. This value matches the offset used in the 20Â MW example in AppendixÂ A.
-   **Land required:** 20Â MW Ã— 5Â acres/MW = **100Â acres**[\[13\]](https://www.pivotenergy.net/blog/solar-farm-land-requirements#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20a%20solar,five%20acres%20of%20buildable%20land).
-   **Cost:** 20Â MW Ã— \$1Â million/MW â‰ˆ **\$20Â million** (excluding land and connection costs).

These calculations underpin the comparative analysis of offsets and underscore why direct emission reductions remain the most costâ€‘effective and practical path to net zero.

## Key takeaways

-   **Deep electrification is essential.** Buildings and vehicles drive most of Brookline's emissions. Rapid adoption of heat pumps, highâ€‘performance envelopes and electric vehicles reduces the need for offsets.

-   **Offsets require new projects.** Offsets are not "credits" that can be purchased from existing renewable energy; they require **net new tree planting or new solar and wind projects** that genuinely displace emissions.

-   **Mobility shifts matter.** Reducing car dependence through improved transit and walkability lowers energy use and the scale of electrification needed.

-   **Local projects have coâ€‘benefits.** Urban tree planting, green infrastructure and regional solar projects sequester carbon while improving air quality and resilience.

-   **Offsets are a bridge, not a destination.** Offsets can **buy time** while Brookline electrifies buildings, expands renewable energy and reduces car use, but they are **not a longâ€‘term solution**. Guidance from Oxford NetÂ Zero emphasises that **shortâ€‘lived offsets help buy time to reduce emissions and invest in longâ€‘lived carbon storage, but they cannot achieve lasting balance on their own**[\[1\]](https://netzeroclimate.org/policies-for-net-zero/net-zero-principles/#:~:text=Short,lived%20storage%20begins%20now). Similarly, experts note that organisations should use offsets as a **transitionary tool to implement more sustainable longâ€‘term strategies**[\[2\]](https://www.3blmedia.com/news/decarbonization-series-part-3-pros-and-cons-carbon-offsets#:~:text=that%20your%20organization%20views%20the,term%20strategies). The UK's Committee on Climate Change cautions that "most sectors ... will need to reduce emissions close to zero without offsetting," reserving offsets only for the hardestâ€‘toâ€‘treat sectors[\[5\]](https://www.netzerocarbonguide.co.uk/guide/early-decisions/what-about-carbon-offsetting#:~:text=Carbon%20offsetting%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20long,shipping%20and%20agriculture%3B%20not%20buildings).

## AppendixÂ CÂ -- Achieving 100Â % renewable electricity byÂ 2040

Brookline's netâ€‘zero pathways assume increasing shares of **renewable electricity**, but none of the offsets considered will clean up the town's entire electricity supply by themselves. Under current Massachusetts policies, the state's grid is projected to reach **about 85Â % renewable electricity byÂ 2040** with roughly **7Â GW of wind and 4.6Â GW of solar**[\[24\]](https://www.ucs.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/on-the-road-100-renewable-ma-fact-sheet.pdf#:~:text=Under%20current%20policies%20and%20plans%E2%80%94the,Electricity%20from%20gas%20drops). To achieve a **100Â % renewable electricity standard** by the midâ€‘2030s, modelling shows that Massachusetts would need **more than 7.5Â GW of wind and nearly 17Â GW of solar plus battery storage**[\[25\]](https://www.ucs.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/on-the-road-100-renewable-ma-fact-sheet.pdf#:~:text=more%20aggressively%2C%20Massachusetts%20can%20meet,Figure%201). Even in that scenario, naturalâ€‘gas plants continue to operate to balance the multiâ€‘state grid[\[26\]](https://www.ucs.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/on-the-road-100-renewable-ma-fact-sheet.pdf#:~:text=While%20renewable%20resources%20meet%20all,is%20exported%20across%20state%20lines).

For Brookline, this means that **relying on the existing grid will not guarantee 100Â % green electricity byÂ 2040**. The town consumed roughly **180,000Â megawattâ€‘hours (MWh)** of electricity in the baseline year, based on its 67,124Â tCOâ‚‚ emissions and the national average grid emission factor of **823.1Â lbÂ COâ‚‚ perÂ MWh (â‰ˆ0.373Â tCOâ‚‚/MWh)**[\[11\]](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20carbon%20dioxide,%28EPA%202024a%3B%20EIA%202023b%29.1). To supply this consumption entirely from new renewable sources, Brookline would need to develop or procure:

-   **New solar capacity:** At a **30Â % capacity factor**, each MW of solar produces about **2,628Â MWh per year** and avoids roughly **980Â tCOâ‚‚**[\[13\]](https://www.pivotenergy.net/blog/solar-farm-land-requirements#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20a%20solar,five%20acres%20of%20buildable%20land)[\[14\]](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/10/26/solar-panels-reduce-co2-emissions-more-per-acre-than-trees-and-much-more-than-corn-ethanol/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20the,208%20to%20236%20times%20more). Meeting 180,000Â MWh would therefore require **about 68Â MW of new solar**, occupying roughly **340Â acres of land** (5Â acres/MW)[\[13\]](https://www.pivotenergy.net/blog/solar-farm-land-requirements#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20a%20solar,five%20acres%20of%20buildable%20land). At an estimated cost of **â‰ˆ\$1Â million per MW**[\[17\]](https://www.solarreviews.com/blog/what-is-a-solar-farm-do-i-need-one#:~:text=,not%20including%20land%20acquisition%20costs)[\[18\]](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_pv#:~:text=in%202022%20is%20based%20on,34), this would entail **â‰ˆ\$68Â million** in capital investment before land leases, grid interconnection and storage costs. These solar projects must be **net new**; buying electricity from existing solar farms does not count as an offset because their carbon reductions are already claimed.

-   **New wind capacity:** Onshore wind turbines operate at **â‰ˆ35Â % capacity factor**[\[21\]](https://visualizingenergy.org/what-are-capacity-factors-and-why-are-they-important/#:~:text=Wind%20%2835,energy%20vary%20dramatically%2C%20and%20significant) and avoid about **2,000Â tCOâ‚‚ per MW** of installed capacity[\[15\]](https://offshorewindfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02_SIOW_Climate-Change_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=average%20of%207%20tons%20of,Power%20generated%20by). Generating 180,000Â MWh per year would require **about 59Â MW of wind capacity**. Landâ€‘based wind costs around **\$1.37Â million per MW**[\[19\]](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=by%2071,26), implying an upfront investment of **â‰ˆ\$81Â million**. Wind farms typically lease land from rural landowners at **\$2--\$15 per acre per year**[\[27\]](https://www.ndsu.edu/agriculture/sites/default/files/2024-10/ag%20lend%20wind-solar%20Haugen%20Oct24%20final%20for%20Web.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Limited%20duration%2C%203%20to,May%20include%20a%20signing%20bonus), and each 2â€‘MW turbine may occupy about oneâ€‘third of an acre but uses surrounding acreage as a setback; large projects require about **85Â acres per MW**[\[19\]](https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/wind-energy-factsheet#:~:text=by%2071,26).

These figures underscore that **Brookline cannot meet its 100Â % renewable electricity goal solely through offsets**. In addition to reducing demand via electrification and mobility shifts, the town would need to **invest in new solar or wind projects** equivalent to tens of megawatts of capacity. Such projects would likely be located outside town boundaries but should be structured to ensure that their emissions reductions are credited to Brookline's target. The investment required---tens of millions of dollars---is comparable to the cost of offsetting residual emissions in some pathways, but unlike offsets, new renewable capacity provides enduring benefits and helps decarbonize the wider regional grid.

Brookline's path to netâ€‘zero by 2040 will likely blend elements of these scenarios. The more the town invests in electrification, renewable energy and mobility shifts, the less it will need to rely on uncertain and extensive offsetting schemes.

## AppendixÂ DÂ -- Land and maintenance costs

Offsets come with additional cost components beyond the capital expenditure for building new renewable energy or planting forests. This appendix summarises the **land lease** costs associated with solar and wind farms and the **maintenance** costs associated with treeâ€‘based offsets. These costs should be considered in addition to the construction costs shown in TableÂ 2.

### Land lease assumptions

Solar developers generally lease farmland rather than purchasing it outright. Typical lease rates range from **\$500 to \$2,000 per acre per year**, with many offers in the **\$1,000 per acre per year** range[\[28\]](https://uslightenergy.com/solar-land-lease-rates-how-much-do-solar-companies-pay-to-lease-land/#:~:text=limits%20of%20lease%20rates%20at,of%20your%20land%E2%80%99s%20lease%20rate)[\[29\]](https://www.agriculture.com/common-offer-to-lease-farmland-for-solar-panels-usd1-000-an-acre-8604982#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20large,less%20than%20%24750%20an%20acre). Because utilityâ€‘scale solar farms require roughly **5Â acres per MW of capacity**[\[13\]](https://www.pivotenergy.net/blog/solar-farm-land-requirements#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20a%20solar,five%20acres%20of%20buildable%20land), the land lease cost works out to about **\$125,000 per MW** for a 25â€‘year lease (5Â acres Ã— \$1,000 Ã— 25Â years). Wind developers typically pay landowners **\$2--\$15 per acre per year** for easements[\[27\]](https://www.ndsu.edu/agriculture/sites/default/files/2024-10/ag%20lend%20wind-solar%20Haugen%20Oct24%20final%20for%20Web.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Limited%20duration%2C%203%20to,May%20include%20a%20signing%20bonus), or alternatively **\$8,000--\$33,000 per turbine per year**[\[30\]](https://ambrook.com/offrange/farm-finance/there-will-be-wind#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20farmers%20who%20add,was%20placed%20on%20the%20property). Assuming a midâ€‘range payment of \$20,000 per 2â€‘MW turbine for 25Â years yields a wind landâ€‘lease cost of about **\$250,000 per MW**.

### Tree maintenance assumptions

The tree costs in TableÂ 2 account only for initial planting. Maintaining an urban or suburban tree requires watering, mulching, pruning and eventual removal. National estimates put average annual maintenance costs at **\$12.87--\$65 per tree**[\[31\]](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/FR279#:~:text=larger%20than%201%20inch%20in,forests%20in%20the%20city%20of). A LosÂ Angeles case study found published studies average **\$34 per tree per year**, while a local lifeâ€‘cycle analysis that includes removal costs estimates **\$96 per tree per year**, with removal representing **28--60Â %** of the annual cost[\[32\]](https://www.treepeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tree-planting-cost-benefit-analysis-a-case-study-for-urban-forest-equity-in-los-angeles.pdf#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20annual%20cost,term%20tree%20care). For simplicity, the estimates below assume a midâ€‘range maintenance cost of **\$30 per tree per year** over a 20â€‘year lifetime (total **\$600 per tree**). Other regions or project types could see higher or lower costs.

### TableÂ 3 -- Additional cost components by pathway

The table below applies the landâ€‘lease and treeâ€‘maintenance assumptions to each pathway. Costs are presented as ranges corresponding to the low and high ends of residual emissions in the **offset requirement table** in the main text. All values are approximate and shown in **million dollars**.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Pathway                     Solar land lease cost (M\$)   Wind land lease cost (M\$)   Tree maintenance cost (M\$)
  --------------------------- ----------------------------- ---------------------------- -----------------------------
  **Electrificationâ€‘First**   \$1.1--2.0                    \$1.0--2.0                   \$91--152

  **Balanced**                \$3.9--5.9                    \$3.5--5.8                   \$305--458

  **AggressiveÂ Mobility**     \$3.9--7.8                    \$3.5--7.8                   \$305--610

  **Offsetâ€‘Heavy**            \$9.8--15.6                   \$8.5--15.3                  \$763--1,221
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These additional costs highlight that longâ€‘term leasing of land and care for planted trees can **dwarf the upfront construction costs** of renewable projects or reforestation. For example, the tree maintenance cost in the offsetâ€‘heavy pathway could exceed **oneÂ billion dollars**, demonstrating why heavily relying on tree offsets is impractical. Similarly, land leases add millions to the cost of solar and wind farms and should be included when budgeting for offsets.

## AppendixÂ EÂ -- Reforestation and tree planting cost assumptions

This appendix clarifies the assumptions behind the reforestation cost estimates used in TableÂ 2 and explains the range of tree planting costs.

### Reforestation cost assumptions

The cost estimates in TableÂ 2 assume that Brookline would invest in **largeâ€‘scale reforestation projects outside the town**, using typical rural reforestation costs rather than urban streetâ€‘tree planting. A national study reports median reforestation costs of **\$1,262 per hectare**, which is approximately **\$511 per acre**[\[16\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349034490_Challenges_to_the_Reforestation_Pipeline_in_the_United_States#:~:text=median%20reforestation%20costs%20to%20be,788%2C%20%241%2C058%2C%20and%20%242%2C098%20per). This cost includes seedlings, site preparation and early maintenance. Based on this assumption, reforesting **one acre per tonne of COâ‚‚** yields the reforestation cost ranges shown in TableÂ 2---for example, offsetting 76,322--122,115Â tCOâ‚‚e in the offsetâ€‘heavy scenario would require **76,322--122,115 acres** and cost **â‰ˆ\$39--\$62Â million** (76,322Â acres Ã— \$511/acre).

### Tree planting cost illustrations (not used in cost calculations)

Tree planting costs vary widely depending on location and context. Largeâ€‘scale rural plantings can be relatively inexpensive---for example, planting 435 seedlings per acre can cost about **\$92 per acre**, or **â‰ˆ\$0.21 per tree**[\[22\]](https://www.uaex.uada.edu/media-resources/news/2022/february2022/02-18-2022-ark-sustaining-forests.aspx#:~:text=Pelkki%20says%20the%20cost%20of,foot%20spacing.%20He%20said%2C%20%22That). At the other extreme, planting a single street tree in a dense urban environment like NewÂ York City can cost about **\$3,300 per tree**[\[23\]](https://forestforall.nyc/costs-city-plant-tree-why/#:~:text=costly,according%20to%20the%20Parks%20Department) because of site preparation and mandated maintenance.

Even using a **midâ€‘range estimate of \$1,500 per tree**---a compromise between lowâ€‘cost rural plantings and highâ€‘cost urban tree programs---planting enough trees to offset Brookline's residual emissions would result in enormous costs:

-   **Electrificationâ€‘First:** 152â€¯,000--254â€¯,000 trees â†’ **\$228--\$381Â million**
-   **Balanced:** 509â€¯,000--763â€¯,000 trees â†’ **\$764--\$1,145Â million**
-   **AggressiveÂ Mobility:** 509â€¯,000--1,017â€¯,000 trees â†’ **\$764--\$1,526Â million**
-   **Offsetâ€‘Heavy:** 1.27--2.04Â million trees â†’ **\$1.9--\$3.1Â billion**

These figures demonstrate why **treeâ€‘only offset strategies are not economically realistic** at the scale required, especially for an urban community like Brookline. Reforestation on rural land may be cheaper, but such projects must occur outside Brookline and still face logistical and ecological constraints.

**Note on assumptions:** The treeâ€‘planting cost figures above are provided for context and are **not** used in the cost calculations for the pathways. The cost estimates in TableÂ 2 are based on the reforestation cost of **\$511 per acre**, which reflects rural planting costs and yields the reforestation cost ranges shown.

## Appendix F - Mapping BERDO implementation options to netâ€‘zero pathways

Brookline's Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO) proposal outlines three implementation options for regulating buildings. These options correspond in different ways to the netâ€‘zero pathways described in this report. A summary of each option and its alignment with the pathways is provided below.

**OptionÂ 1 -- Low impact (conservative start).** This option applies only to **nonâ€‘residential buildings â‰¥20,000Â squareÂ feet** and would reduce Brookline's total GHG emissions by about **12Â %**. It affects roughly **2Â % of buildings** and is politically and administratively easy to implement. Because it leaves the vast majority of building emissions untouched, achieving net zero under this option would require extensive **offsets** or other compensatory measures. It therefore resembles the **offsetâ€‘heavy pathway** in this report, which relies on purchasing large amounts of offsets to balance residual emissions.

**OptionÂ 2 -- Medium impact (MAÂ LBER alignment).** This option covers **all commercial and residential buildings â‰¥20,000Â squareÂ feet** and yields a **19Â % reduction** in Brookline's total GHG emissions. It would apply to about **5Â % of buildings** and has moderate feasibility and administrative burden. In the phased implementation plan, OptionÂ 2 introduces an **Alternative Compliance Payment** system of **\$234 per tonne of COâ‚‚e**, allowing building owners who cannot meet emissions targets to pay into a fund. This combination of significant building coverage and a formal offset mechanism aligns closely with the **balanced electrificationÂ +Â offsets pathway**: many large buildings electrify, but a meaningful share of residual emissions is covered via offsets funded by compliance payments.

**OptionÂ 3 -- High impact (comprehensive).** This option would include **all buildings, including 1â€‘3â€‘family homes**, and is projected to reduce Brookline's total GHG emissions by **43Â %**. It would affect **97Â % of buildings** and require a high administrative effort. OptionÂ 3 is the most ambitious of the three BERDO proposals, but it still falls short of the nearâ€‘universal electrification envisioned in the **electrificationâ€‘first pathway** and retains the alternative compliance payment system introduced in earlier phases. As such, it maps to the **balanced electrificationÂ +Â offsets pathway**---Brookline would achieve substantial emissions reductions through building upgrades while using offsets or payments to neutralise residual emissions. To fully realise the electrificationâ€‘first pathway, Brookline would need to go beyond OptionÂ 3 by requiring fossilâ€‘fuel phaseâ€‘out in all buildings and investing heavily in renewable electricity.
