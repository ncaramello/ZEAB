# ZEAB (Zero Emissions Advisory Board) Repository

## Mission

The Zero Emissions Advisory Board (ZEAB) is committed to guiding the Town of Brookline toward achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. This repository serves as the central knowledge base for our strategies, analyses, and initiatives.

## File Format Guidance

While this repository accepts all file formats, we encourage using git-friendly text formats (Markdown, CSV, plain text) for working documents when practical. This enables better version control and collaboration.

- **Markdown (.md)** works well for documents and reports
- **CSV** is useful for data that doesn't require complex formulas
- **Binary formats** (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF) are fine when needed

See `CLAUDE.md` for guidance when using AI assistants with this repository.
