# EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

# Purpose

Develop a warrant article to establish a Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO) in Brookline, targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 in alignment with WA37 (approved May 2021).

Key Statistics

-   **43%** of Brookline\'s GHG emissions come from onsite fossil fuel combustion in buildings

-   **45%** from residential buildings (homes, condos, apartments)

-   **19%** from non-residential buildings

-   **Massachusetts context**: Boston, Cambridge, Lexington, and Newton have enacted BERDO laws

# Three Implementation Options

-   **Political Feasibility**: High

-   **Administrative Burden**: Low

Option 2: Medium Impact (MA LBER Alignment)

-   **Scope**: All buildings subject to MA LBER (â‰¥20,000 SF, commercial and residential)

-   **Climate Impact**: 19% reduction in total Brookline GHG emissions

-   **Buildings Affected**: \~5% of Brookline buildings

-   **Political Feasibility**: Moderate

-   **Administrative Burden**: Moderate

Option 3: High Impact (Comprehensive)

-   **Scope**: All buildings including 1-3 family homes

-   **Climate Impact**: 43% reduction in total Brookline GHG emissions

# MARKETING MATERIAL

## 1. Persuasive / Political Version (for Town Meeting Members & Policy Stakeholders)

**Title:** *BERDO: Building Brookline's Path to Net Zero*

**Why BERDO?**

-   **43% of emissions** in Brookline come from buildings.

-   **Peer towns (Boston, Cambridge, Lexington, Newton)** already have BERDOs.

-   A phased Brookline BERDO ensures **measurable reductions, local control, and equity protections**.

**Key Benefits**

-   **Climate Leadership:** Positions Brookline as a leader in Massachusetts municipal climate policy.

-   **Economic Sense:** Alternative Compliance Payments could generate **\$2--5M annually** to offset program costs and fund equity programs.

-   **Political Strategy:** Start conservatively, prove success, then expand.

**Implementation Strategy**

-   **Phase 1 (2026--28):** Cover large non-residential buildings â‰¥20,000 SF. Establish Review Board, reporting, and compliance systems.

-   **Phase 2 (2029--31):** Add large residential buildings. Introduce ACP system and equity fund.

-   **Phase 3 (2032--35):** Gradually expand to smaller buildings, with exemptions and assistance.

-   **Phase 4 (2036--40):** Full net-zero coverage.

**Governance & Resources**

-   **Review Board:** 7--9 members, with equity and environmental expertise.

-   **Staffing:** 4--5 FTE at maturity; fully offset by ACP revenue.

-   **Flexibility:** Ordinance drafted to allow future expansions via amendments, without rewriting.

**Why Town Meeting Should Support**

-   **Low political risk:** Conservative start with high feasibility.

-   **High return:** Significant emissions reductions, self-funding mechanism.

-   **Equity-first design:** Prevents burden on vulnerable households.

## 2. Public-Friendly Flyer (for Residents & Building Owners)

**Title:** *Cleaner, Healthier, Smarter Buildings for Brookline*\
*What is BERDO and why does it matter for you?*

**What is BERDO?**

BERDO = **Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance**.\
It's a law that helps us **track, report, and reduce energy use in buildings**, making Brookline healthier and more affordable.

**Why Buildings?**

-   **43% of our greenhouse gases come from buildings.**

-   Homes, apartments, offices---all contribute to climate change.

-   Cleaner buildings mean **lower bills, healthier air, and stronger neighborhoods**.

**What Will Happen First?**

-   **2026--2028:** Only big commercial buildings (like offices and institutions) need to report energy use.

-   **2029--2031:** Large apartment buildings and condos join.

-   **2032--2035:** Gradual expansion to more properties with lots of support programs.

-   **By 2040:** Every building in Brookline is part of the solution.

**How Will This Help Me?**

-   **Lower energy bills** from efficiency upgrades.

-   **Cleaner air indoors and outdoors** by reducing fossil fuels.

-   **Support for all residents**---equity programs ensure affordability and protect renters.

-   **Local jobs and training** in clean energy.

**Who's Paying?**

-   Initial setup is modest (\$300k).

-   Over time, building owners who don't meet standards can make an **Alternative Compliance Payment**.

-   These payments will fund **millions in local support programs** to help residents and building owners.

**Brookline Joins Our Neighbors**

Boston, Cambridge, Lexington, and Newton already have BERDOs. Brookline should, too. Together, we can lead Massachusetts toward a **healthier, more affordable, net-zero future**.
