# Addendum: External Sources Referenced in the Brookline BERDO Bylaw

The Brookline Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Bylaw (BERDO) draws on best practices from other jurisdictions and state programs. In keeping with common legal drafting conventions, the body of the bylaw omits hyperlinks; this addendum lists the primary external sources consulted, with brief descriptions of how they informed the bylaw. The citations in the bylaw correspond to these resources.

## Massachusetts SelectÂ Board Handbook -- *City vs. Town Distinction*

-   **Source:** Massachusetts Municipal Association, **MassachusettsÂ SelectÂ Board Handbook, ChapterÂ 3 -- Organization of Town Government:Â CityÂ vs.Â Town Distinction**\
    <https://www.mma.org/members/msa/massachusetts-select-board-handbook/chapter-3-organization-of-town-government/city-vs-town-distinction/>
-   **Relevance:** This section of the handbook explains the structural differences between city and town governments in Massachusetts. It notes that cities are governed by a small elected legislative body (a council) and an elected or appointed chief executive, whereas towns are governed by a large legislative body---an **Open or Representative Town Meeting**---and an elected **SelectÂ Board**[\[1\]](https://www.mma.org/members/msa/massachusetts-select-board-handbook/chapter-3-organization-of-town-government/city-vs-town-distinction/#:~:text=Note%20that%20%E2%80%9Crepresentative%E2%80%9D%20in%20these,Meeting%20or%20a%20representative%20one). It further explains that **Town Meeting is responsible for appropriations and enacting local laws, known as bylaws**[\[2\]](https://www.mma.org/members/msa/massachusetts-select-board-handbook/chapter-3-organization-of-town-government/city-vs-town-distinction/#:~:text=Town%20Meeting%2C%20the%20legislative%20body,local%20laws%2C%20known%20as%20bylaws). These passages underpin the preamble of Brookline's bylaw, which clarifies that Brookline is a town and therefore enacts bylaws through Town Meeting rather than ordinances through a city council.

## MassachusettsÂ LargeÂ BuildingÂ EnergyÂ ReportingÂ (LBER) Policy

-   **Source:** Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, **LargeÂ BuildingÂ EnergyÂ ReportingÂ Policy**\
    <https://www.mass.gov/info-details/large-building-energy-reporting-policy>
-   **Relevance:** This state policy page describes the LBER law created by *AnÂ ActÂ Driving CleanÂ Energy and OffshoreÂ Wind* (2022). It notes that the law requires disclosure of **EnergyÂ Usage data for buildings greater than or equal to 20,000Â squareÂ feet starting inÂ 2025**[\[3\]](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/large-building-energy-reporting-policy#:~:text=Large%20Building%20Energy%20Reporting%20,starting%20in%202025). The law directs **electric, gas and steam utilities to report usage on behalf of covered buildings** and requires building owners to report **additional energy sources such as oil, propane, wood and onâ€‘site renewable generation**[\[4\]](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/large-building-energy-reporting-policy#:~:text=The%20law%20requires%20electric%2C%20gas%2C,site%20renewable%20energy%20generation). The page also states that **DOER will publicly disclose energy usage** for these buildings[\[5\]](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/large-building-energy-reporting-policy#:~:text=What%20is%20LBER%3F). These provisions explain why Brookline relies on the state's BEAM platform for energyâ€‘usage data and requires supplemental emissions information for greenhouseâ€‘gas calculations.

## Complying with Massachusetts' LargeÂ BuildingÂ EnergyÂ ReportingÂ Law

-   **Source:** Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, **ComplyingÂ withÂ Massachusetts' LargeÂ BuildingÂ EnergyÂ ReportingÂ Law**\
    <https://www.mass.gov/info-details/complying-with-massachusetts-large-building-energy-reporting-law>
-   **Relevance:** This guidance document explains compliance options for building owners. It highlights that **reports filed under Boston's BuildingÂ Emissions Reduction andÂ Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO) and Cambridge's BuildingÂ Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) count as LBER reporting**[\[6\]](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/complying-with-massachusetts-large-building-energy-reporting-law#:~:text=Complying%20with%20LBER%20if%20you,benchmark%20in%20another%20program). The bylaw uses this guidance to allow building owners who already comply with BERDO or BEUDO to satisfy Brookline's reporting requirements without duplicative filings. The document also describes the automated and selfâ€‘managed reporting options, which inform Brookline's integration of BEAM as the primary benchmarking tool.
