# Synopses of Existing Buildingâ€‘Performance Ordinances

This document summarises the **Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO)** adopted by Boston, the **Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO)** adopted by Cambridge, and the **Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO)** adopted by Newton. These synopses draw on official city sources and include citations for major provisions.

## Boston -- BERDOÂ 2.0

Boston updated its Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance inÂ 2021, creating a performance standard (commonly called **BERDOÂ 2.0**) that applies to the largest buildings in the city. Key features include:

-   **Covered buildings.** BERDO applies to **nonâ€‘residential buildings â‰¥20â€¯000â€¯ftÂ²** and **residential buildings with 15Â or more units or â‰¥20â€¯000â€¯ftÂ²**[\[1\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/berdo#:~:text=Who%20is%20covered%3F). Multiple buildings on a single tax parcel are aggregated for coverage[\[1\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/berdo#:~:text=Who%20is%20covered%3F).
-   **Purpose and targets.** The ordinance aims to reduce air pollution and greenhouseâ€‘gas emissions from large buildings; it requires covered buildings to comply with declining **emissions standards** that decrease over time[\[2\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/berdo#:~:text=owners%20who%20need%20extra%20assistance,com). The standards begin in **2025 or 2030** depending on building size and type[\[3\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/berdo#:~:text=1,compliance%20year), and all covered buildings must reach **netâ€‘zero emissions byÂ 2050**[\[2\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/berdo#:~:text=owners%20who%20need%20extra%20assistance,com).
-   **Reporting and verification.** Owners must annually report energy use and greenhouseâ€‘gas emissions through EPA's Portfolio Manager and comply with thirdâ€‘party verification requirements in designated **verification years** (e.g., 2026, 2030, 2034)[\[4\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/berdo#:~:text=HOW%20DO%20I%20COMPLY%20WITH,PARTY%20VERIFICATION).
-   **Compliance pathways.** Building owners can meet emissions caps directly, aggregate multiple buildings into a **portfolio**, adopt **individual compliance schedules**, or apply for **hardship plans**.
-   **Alternative compliance and equity.** BERDO established an **EquitableÂ Emissions Investment Fund**. The fund supports projects that reduce building emissions and prioritises **Environmental Justice populations**; it is initially seeded with city funds and will receive revenue from BERDO fines and **alternative compliance payments**[\[5\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/equitable-emissions-investment-fund#:~:text=The%C2%A0Building%20Emissions%20Reduction%20and%20Disclosure,established%20to%20support%20this%20goal). A nineâ€‘member **BERDO Review Board** oversees the ordinance and allocates funding.

## Cambridge -- BEUDO (2023 amendments)

Cambridge's **Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO)** was adopted inÂ 2014 and amended inÂ 2023 to impose emissionsâ€‘reduction requirements on large nonâ€‘residential buildings. Key provisions include:

-   **Coverage.** Buildings **below 25â€¯000â€¯ftÂ²** are not covered[\[6\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Buildings%20below%2025%2C000%20square%20feet,not%20covered%20by%20BEUDO%20regulations), and residential buildings of any size are only required to **report energy and water use**[\[7\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Residential%20buildings%2C%20regardless%20of%20size%2C,energy%20and%20water%20use%20data). The 2023 amendments require only larger nonâ€‘residential buildings to reduce emissions:
-   **Nonâ€‘residential â‰¥100â€¯000â€¯ftÂ²** must reduce greenhouseâ€‘gas emissions to **netâ€‘zero byÂ 2035**[\[8\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=%2A%20Non,to%20net%20zero%20by%202035).
-   **Nonâ€‘residential 25â€¯000--100â€¯000â€¯ftÂ²** must start reducing emissions in **2030** and reach **netâ€‘zero byÂ 2050**[\[8\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=%2A%20Non,to%20net%20zero%20by%202035).
-   **Benchmarking and baseline.** Covered buildings must benchmark energy and water use annually using ENERGYÂ STAR Portfolio Manager[\[9\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Owners%20of%20all%20Covered%20Properties,in%20a%20process%20called%20benchmarking). Owners must establish a baseline by averaging emissions over any two consecutive years betweenÂ 2010--2019 and must verify baseline data as well as all years starting inÂ 2026[\[10\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=The%20baseline%20is%20the%20initial,in%20energy%20efficiency%20and%20electrification).
-   **Compliance options.** BEUDO allows several mechanisms for achieving netâ€‘zero:
-   **Renewable energy procurement.** Beginning inÂ 2026, building owners may purchase renewable electricity through powerâ€‘purchase agreements (PPAs and VPPAs)[\[11\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Purchase%20Renewable%20Energy%3A%20Starting%20in,VPPAs).
-   **Verified Carbon Credits (VCCs).** Starting inÂ 2030, nonâ€‘residential buildings â‰¥100â€¯000â€¯ftÂ² may purchase VCCs to offset a portion of thermal emissions[\[12\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Verified%20Carbon%20Credits%3A%20Starting%20in,site%20thermal%20energy%20emissions).
-   **Alternative Compliance Payments (ACPs).** Owners may make payments to offset emissions; one **Alternative Compliance Credit** equals one metric ton of COâ‚‚e. The cost for 2026--2030 is **\$234 per metric ton**[\[13\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Alternative%20Compliance%20Payments%3A%20are%20payments,234%2FmT%20for%202026%20to%202030).
-   **Deferrals and hardship compliance plans.** Owners can request deferral of requirements for up to five years and propose hardship plans if they face financial or technical challenges[\[14\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Deferrals%3A%20Building%20owners%20can%20apply,for%20up%20to%20five%20years).
-   **Equity and use of funds.** City documents explain that monies from alternative compliance credits must be used solely for programs that directly reduce carbon emissions, including projects in **affordable housing**; funds are deposited into a cityâ€‘managed account and allocated under guidance from the Affordable Housing Trust (language quoted in the Brookline proposal).

## Newton -- BERDO (2024 ordinance)

Newton adopted its own BERDO in DecemberÂ 2024. Salient features include:

-   **Covered buildings.** The ordinance initially applies to **commercial buildings â‰¥20â€¯000â€¯ftÂ²** (institutional and industrial are included). Newton plans to add **residential buildings â‰¥20â€¯000â€¯ftÂ²** in a later phase[\[15\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=BERDO%20Notes%20for%20PEX%20Meeting,vote%20to%20approve%20BERDO%2038)[\[16\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=Buildings%20Covered%20%E2%80%A2%20BERDO%20covers,including%20centrally%20heated%20residential%20condos). According to city materials, Newton has **293 commercial buildings** over 20â€¯000â€¯ftÂ² and **120 residential buildings** that will eventually be covered[\[15\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=BERDO%20Notes%20for%20PEX%20Meeting,vote%20to%20approve%20BERDO%2038).
-   **Emissions scope.** Newton's BERDO **excludes electricity emissions** from compliance; building owners must report electricity usage but are not penalised for purchased electricity emissions[\[17\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=PEX%20vendor%20notes%20%E2%80%A2%20Newton,whole%20building%20all%20at%20once). The ordinance instead targets onâ€‘site fossilâ€‘fuel combustion, giving owners **20--25Â years** to achieve zero emissions[\[17\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=PEX%20vendor%20notes%20%E2%80%A2%20Newton,whole%20building%20all%20at%20once).
-   **Timelines and compliance periods.** The program uses **five compliance intervals** between 2026 andÂ 2050. The first interval begins in **2026--2028**, and standards gradually tighten through **2050**[\[18\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Scope%3A%20Includes%20direct%20emissions,year%203%20of%20emission%20standards). Penalties for exceeding standards are not assessed until a standard has been in place for **three years**[\[18\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Scope%3A%20Includes%20direct%20emissions,year%203%20of%20emission%20standards).
-   **Justification and coverage statistics.** Newton's BERDO aims to reduce emissions from a small set of large buildings that collectively account for a significant share of the city's GHG emissions. The city's presentations note that **293 commercial buildings (1.3Â % of Newton's building stock) produce 23Â % of Newton's total emissions**[\[19\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Substantially%20reduces%20Newton%E2%80%99s%20total,strategies%20in%20Greater%20Boston%20area).
-   **Program administration.** Newton emphasises simplicity: it uses **EnergyÂ STAR Portfolio Manager** for reporting and coordinates with the state's Large Building Energy Reporting program. Thirdâ€‘party verification occurs every five years, and fines are directed to local environmentalâ€‘justice projects; the city also provides owner assistance and training[\[18\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Scope%3A%20Includes%20direct%20emissions,year%203%20of%20emission%20standards).
-   **Positive framing and benefits.** Environmental advocates highlight that Newton's BERDO will help move large buildings off fossil fuels, reduce cityâ€‘wide emissions and enable the city to meet its **netâ€‘zero byÂ 2050** commitment. Articles from local environmental groups explain that the ordinance requires commercial buildings to measure emissions and achieve progressively stricter standards while residential buildings report energy use; large buildings account for 23Â % of Newton's GHG emissions, making this ordinance a significant climate tool[\[20\]](https://greennewton.org/what-is-berdo-answers-to-your-questions/#:~:text=In%20December%202024%2C%20Newton%E2%80%99s%20City,being%20used%20in%20the%20city).
-   **Cost concerns.** Press coverage also notes potential costs. A NewtonÂ Beacon analysis presented to the City Council estimated that compliance could raise rents by roughly **4Â %** for residential and commercial tenants and that capital costs range from **\$5--35 per square foot** (amortised over 20Â years)[\[21\]](https://www.newtonbeacon.org/how-much-could-the-proposed-berdo-cost-property-owners/#:~:text=Cost%20of%20compliance). It also noted that the ordinance would cost the city up to **\$290â€¯000 per year** for staffing and administration[\[22\]](https://www.newtonbeacon.org/how-much-could-the-proposed-berdo-cost-property-owners/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20costs%20to,to%20administer%20the%20BERDO%20program).

## Takeâ€‘aways for Brookline

The three ordinances share common elements---coverage thresholds, reporting obligations, progressive emissions targets and alternative compliance mechanisms---yet they reflect different local priorities. Boston's law is the most comprehensive, imposing emissions caps on both commercial and residential buildings and using an EquitableÂ Emissions InvestmentÂ Fund to channel resources to environmentalâ€‘justice communities[\[5\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/equitable-emissions-investment-fund#:~:text=The%C2%A0Building%20Emissions%20Reduction%20and%20Disclosure,established%20to%20support%20this%20goal). Cambridge focuses on large nonâ€‘residential buildings and adopts an earlier netâ€‘zero date (**2035** for \>100Â kÂ ftÂ²) with limited use of offsets and a clear price on alternative compliance credits[\[8\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=%2A%20Non,to%20net%20zero%20by%202035)[\[13\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Alternative%20Compliance%20Payments%3A%20are%20payments,234%2FmT%20for%202026%20to%202030). Newton emphasises a slower rampâ€‘up, excludes electricity from compliance, and tailors its program to a small number of large buildings while providing extended timelines and substantial owner assistance[\[17\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=PEX%20vendor%20notes%20%E2%80%A2%20Newton,whole%20building%20all%20at%20once)[\[18\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Scope%3A%20Includes%20direct%20emissions,year%203%20of%20emission%20standards). These differences offer a spectrum of policy choices for Brookline's ordinance.
