### Observations

-   **Threshold differences:** Boston and Newton use 20â€¯000Â ftÂ² for both commercial and residential coverage, while Cambridge's threshold is 25â€¯000Â ftÂ² and adds an accelerated schedule for â‰¥100Â kÂ ftÂ² buildings[\[6\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Buildings%20below%2025%2C000%20square%20feet,not%20covered%20by%20BEUDO%20regulations). Brookline's proposal lists options aligned with MAÂ LBER (â‰¥20Â kÂ ftÂ²) but leaves open whether to cover smaller buildings.
-   **Netâ€‘zero timelines:** Cambridge's largest buildings must decarbonize by **2035**[\[7\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=%2A%20Non,to%20net%20zero%20by%202035), earlier than Boston's **2050** target[\[3\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/berdo#:~:text=owners%20who%20need%20extra%20assistance,com). Newton aims for zero onâ€‘site fossilâ€‘fuel combustion by 2050 but allows owners 20--25Â years[\[17\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=PEX%20vendor%20notes%20%E2%80%A2%20Newton,whole%20building%20all%20at%20once). Brookline seeks a **2040** finish, more ambitious than Boston/Newton but slower than Cambridge's largestâ€‘building timeline.
-   **Electricity treatment:** Newton excludes electricity from compliance[\[17\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=PEX%20vendor%20notes%20%E2%80%A2%20Newton,whole%20building%20all%20at%20once), while Boston and Cambridge include it and allow alternative compliance payments or renewable procurement. Brookline's proposal leans toward Newton's approach---report but do not penalize electricity use---citing fairness for owners who electrify their buildings.
-   **Alternative compliance pricing:** Both Boston and Cambridge set alternative compliance payments around **\$234 per metric ton**[\[11\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Alternative%20Compliance%20Payments%3A%20are%20payments,234%2FmT%20for%202026%20to%202030); Newton's costs are unspecified but fines fund local environmentalâ€‘justice projects. Brookline's plan adopts the \$234/mT figure in PhaseÂ 2.

## 2Â Press commentary

Understanding stakeholder sentiment helps anticipate political challenges. Below are selected perspectives from news and advocacy sources.

### Positive perspectives

-   **Boston's equitable process:** An NRDC blog celebrates Boston's BERDOÂ 2.0, noting that the ordinance is a "win for residents" because it was developed through a transparent process that centered the priorities of those most affected by pollution and housing costs[\[18\]](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/emily-barkdoll/boston-passes-equitable-building-performance-standard#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20win%20for,residents). The article highlights coâ€‘benefits such as **better air quality**, **reduced energy bills** and an **equitable emissions investment fund** administered by a review board[\[19\]](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/emily-barkdoll/boston-passes-equitable-building-performance-standard#:~:text=Boston%20has%20taken%20a%20huge,be%20net%20zero%20by%202050)[\[18\]](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/emily-barkdoll/boston-passes-equitable-building-performance-standard#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20win%20for,residents).
-   **Newton advocates:** Green Newton describes Newton's BERDO as an important step toward netâ€‘zero and explains that large commercial buildings account for 23Â % of the city's GHG emissions; requiring them to measure emissions and reduce over time will help meet the city's climate goals[\[20\]](https://greennewton.org/what-is-berdo-answers-to-your-questions/#:~:text=In%20December%202024%2C%20Newton%E2%80%99s%20City,being%20used%20in%20the%20city). An article on the ordinance's passage notes that the city council approved it **23--0** and frames it as a significant climate milestone[\[21\]](https://greennewton.org/berdo-passed-by-newton-city-council/#:~:text=Great%20News%21%20BERDO%20,to%20reduce%20their%20GHG%20emissions).

### Critiques and concerns

-   **Cambridge smallâ€‘business anxiety:** A CambridgeÂ Day article details concerns from small property owners who fear that BEUDO's accelerated timeline and costs are unrealistic. One property manager notes that universities have sustainability teams but most owners do not: *"I am the sustainability team. If the city is serious about going carbon neutral, you have to help people get there"*[\[22\]](https://www.cambridgeday.com/2022/08/25/smaller-business-and-property-owners-anxious-over-costs-of-new-clean-energy-requirements/#:~:text=consultants%20to%20evaluate%20the%20costs%2C,Barrett%20said). Another owner criticizes the ordinance for including apartment buildings while omitting large singleâ€‘family homes, arguing that this inequity places greater burdens on multifamily buildings[\[23\]](https://www.cambridgeday.com/2022/08/25/smaller-business-and-property-owners-anxious-over-costs-of-new-clean-energy-requirements/#:~:text=Charlie%20Marquardt%2C%20owner%20of%20Mid,family%20homes%2C%20he%20said). The article also records civic complaints about the process, such as hearings being cancelled and lastâ€‘minute changes to ordinance language[\[24\]](https://www.cambridgeday.com/2022/08/25/smaller-business-and-property-owners-anxious-over-costs-of-new-clean-energy-requirements/#:~:text=The%20cancellation%20of%20Beudo%20hearings,%E2%80%9D). Commenters warn that electrification without major grid upgrades could lead to higher upstream emissions and grid bottlenecks[\[25\]](https://www.cambridgeday.com/2022/08/25/smaller-business-and-property-owners-anxious-over-costs-of-new-clean-energy-requirements/#:~:text=leaves%20us%20burning%20more%20coal,know%20nothing%20about%20how%20buildings).
-   **Boston compliance challenges:** A Boston.com report notes that **few building owners had submitted their greenhouseâ€‘gas data** by lateÂ 2022, prompting the city to extend reporting deadlines[\[26\]](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2022/11/20/barely-any-boston-buildings-have-reported-their-greenhouse-gas-emissions-despite-new-rule/#:~:text=Boston%20building%20owners%20might%20be,15). Business groups expressed concerns about how BERDO fits with other state and federal programs and flagged difficulties in verifying data[\[27\]](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2022/11/20/barely-any-boston-buildings-have-reported-their-greenhouse-gas-emissions-despite-new-rule/#:~:text=Boston%20building%20owners%20might%20be,15).
-   **Newton cost impacts:** The NewtonÂ Beacon reports that meeting BERDO requirements could increase rents by about **4Â %** and that capital costs for compliance range from **\$5--35 per square foot**[\[28\]](https://www.newtonbeacon.org/how-much-could-the-proposed-berdo-cost-property-owners/#:~:text=Cost%20of%20compliance). It also notes that the city must budget up to **\$290â€¯000 per year** for administration[\[29\]](https://www.newtonbeacon.org/how-much-could-the-proposed-berdo-cost-property-owners/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20costs%20to,to%20administer%20the%20BERDO%20program). These concerns suggest that policymakers will need to balance decarbonization goals with affordability and economic impacts.

## 3Â Gaps and opportunities for Brookline

-   **Balancing ambition and feasibility.** Brookline's proposed **2040 netâ€‘zero target** is more ambitious than Boston's and Newton's 2050 goals but less aggressive than Cambridge's requirement for very large buildings to decarbonize by 2035. Adopting Cambridge's accelerated timeline for buildings â‰¥100â€¯000Â ftÂ² could focus early action on the largest emitters while retaining a 2040 goal for smaller buildings.
-   **Scope decisions.** The choice of threshold will determine the number of buildings covered. Aligning with MAÂ LBER (â‰¥20Â kÂ ftÂ²) ensures consistency and administrative simplicity but covers more buildings than Cambridge's 25Â kÂ ftÂ² threshold. Brookline's plan contemplates gradually lowering the threshold to 5Â 000Â ftÂ²; however, this expansion will require additional staff and support programmes.
-   **Electricity emissions.** Brookline must decide whether to count electricity emissions. Excluding them (Newton model) would reduce complexity and avoid penalizing electrified buildings but may limit overall emissions reductions. Including electricity (Boston/Cambridge model) encourages renewable procurement and deeper decarbonization but requires more complex accounting.
-   **Alternative compliance design.** Lessons from Boston and Cambridge suggest that alternative compliance payments should be tied to an **equitable investment fund** and priced high enough (\$234/mT) to incentivize direct reductions[\[11\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Alternative%20Compliance%20Payments%3A%20are%20payments,234%2FmT%20for%202026%20to%202030). Brookline can also incorporate Cambridgeâ€‘style limits on the use of offsets (declining caps on VerifiedÂ Carbon Credits) to ensure local benefits.
-   **Equity and support.** All three ordinances provide support for environmentalâ€‘justice communities---Boston through its EquitableÂ Emissions InvestmentÂ Fund[\[4\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/equitable-emissions-investment-fund#:~:text=The%C2%A0Building%20Emissions%20Reduction%20and%20Disclosure,established%20to%20support%20this%20goal), Cambridge through funding that prioritizes affordable housing projects, and Newton through local reinvestment of fines. Brookline's proposal rightly emphasises an **Equitable Emissions Investment Fund** and suggests assistance programmes and financing options; implementing these elements effectively will be critical for equity and political acceptance.
-   **Stakeholder engagement.** Press coverage highlights the importance of robust outreach. Cambridge's rollâ€‘out faced criticism for insufficient communication and limited support for small businesses[\[30\]](https://www.cambridgeday.com/2022/08/25/smaller-business-and-property-owners-anxious-over-costs-of-new-clean-energy-requirements/#:~:text=consultants%20to%20evaluate%20the%20costs%2C,Barrett%20said). Boston had to extend deadlines because few owners submitted data[\[26\]](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2022/11/20/barely-any-boston-buildings-have-reported-their-greenhouse-gas-emissions-despite-new-rule/#:~:text=Boston%20building%20owners%20might%20be,15). Brookline's plan includes a detailed **stakeholder engagement plan** (PhaseÂ 1A/B/C), which should be fully implemented to avoid similar pitfalls.

## Summary

Brookline's proposed BERDO can draw on the strengths of neighbouring ordinances while addressing their shortcomings. An effective ordinance will balance ambition and feasibility, adopt equitable compliance mechanisms, provide robust support programmes, and engage stakeholders early and often. The press commentary underscores that even wellâ€‘designed policies face opposition unless they are paired with financial assistance, clear communication, and sensitivity to cost impacts. By learning from Boston, Cambridge and Newton, Brookline can craft a buildingâ€‘performance standard that accelerates decarbonization, protects vulnerable populations and enjoys durable political support.
