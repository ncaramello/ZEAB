# Draft Ordinance: Brookline Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO)

*Note: This draft is based on the Brookline BERDO proposal and plan and integrates best practices from Boston's BERDOÂ 2.0, Cambridge's BEUDO amendments and Newton's BERDO. It is intended as a starting point for legal counsel and the Brookline Town Meeting. Citations to other ordinances are provided for reference.*

## SectionÂ 1Â -- Purpose and Findings

1.1Â Brookline hereby enacts a **Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO)** to reduce greenhouseâ€‘gas emissions from existing buildings, improve public health, advance climate resiliency and achieve the Town's commitment to **netâ€‘zero emissions byÂ 2040** as established under Warrant ArticleÂ 37. Buildings account for approximately **43Â %** of Brookline's GHG emissions, including 19Â % from nonâ€‘residential buildings and 24Â % from residential uses (oneâ€‘toâ€‘threeâ€‘family homes, condominiums and apartments).

1.2Â The Town recognizes that other Massachusetts municipalities have adopted buildingâ€‘performance ordinances---Boston's BERDOÂ 2.0 covers nonâ€‘residential buildings â‰¥20â€¯000â€¯ftÂ² and residential buildings with 15+ units[\[1\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/berdo#:~:text=Who%20is%20covered%3F), Cambridge's BEUDO requires nonâ€‘residential buildings â‰¥100â€¯000â€¯ftÂ² to reach netâ€‘zero byÂ 2035 and buildings 25--100Â kÂ ftÂ² byÂ 2050[\[2\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=%2A%20Non,to%20net%20zero%20by%202035), and Newton's BERDO covers commercial buildings â‰¥20â€¯000Â ftÂ² and phases in residential buildings later[\[3\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=BERDO%20Notes%20for%20PEX%20Meeting,vote%20to%20approve%20BERDO%2038). This ordinance draws upon these precedents while tailoring provisions to Brookline's building stock and equity priorities.

1.3Â The Town finds that achieving emissions reductions from buildings must be accomplished equitably. Buildingâ€‘performance standards can impose burdens on owners who lack capital or technical resources and on tenants through increased rents. The Town therefore establishes an **EquitableÂ Emissions Investment Fund** (SectionÂ 7) and support programmes to ensure benefits accrue to EnvironmentalÂ Justice (EJ) populations and affordable housing.

## SectionÂ 2Â -- Definitions

**Building.** Any structure used or intended for sheltering any occupancy or use. For purposes of this ordinance:

-   **Nonâ€‘residential building** means a building, or group of buildings on a parcel, with a total gross floor area of **20â€¯000Â ftÂ² or more** used for commercial, institutional, industrial, educational or mixed uses.
-   **Residential building** means a building or group of buildings containing **15 or more dwelling units** or having **20â€¯000Â ftÂ² or more** of gross floor area used for residential purposes. Condominium associations shall aggregate units to determine coverage.
-   **Large building** refers to a nonâ€‘residential building **â‰¥100â€¯000Â ftÂ²**, which is subject to accelerated emissions requirements (SectionÂ 5.2).

**Covered building.** A nonâ€‘residential or residential building meeting the size or unit thresholds defined above, subject to reporting and compliance requirements in the applicable phase.

**Portfolio.** A group of covered buildings under common ownership or control that elect to comply by aggregating their emissions (SectionÂ 6.3).

**Netâ€‘zero emissions.** For a covered building, achieving zero annual greenhouseâ€‘gas emissions from onâ€‘site fossilâ€‘fuel combustion and purchased energy, after accounting for renewable energy procurement and allowable offsets.

**Verification year.** A calendar year in which covered buildings must submit thirdâ€‘party verified emissions reports (see SectionÂ 4.5). Verification years occur every five years beginning inÂ 2026.

Other terms (e.g., **emissions factors**, **AlternativeÂ Compliance Payment**, **VerifiedÂ Carbon Credit**, **EnvironmentalÂ Justice population**) shall be defined by regulation.

## SectionÂ 3Â -- Applicability and Phased Implementation

3.1Â **Phases of coverage.** The ordinance shall be implemented through four phases. Each phase may be enacted by the Select Board, subject to ratification by Town Meeting.

-   **PhaseÂ 1 (2026--2028)** -- Applies to **nonâ€‘residential buildings â‰¥20â€¯000Â ftÂ²**. Building owners must report annual energy use and greenhouseâ€‘gas emissions beginning with calendar yearÂ 2026. Emissions standards do not apply in this phase but will inform baseline development.

-   **PhaseÂ 2 (2029--2031)** -- Adds **residential buildings â‰¥20â€¯000Â ftÂ² or 15+ units**. Emissions standards take effect for large nonâ€‘residential buildings (â‰¥100â€¯000Â ftÂ²) beginning with emissions yearÂ 2030. Owners may satisfy standards directly or through compliance pathways under SectionÂ 6.

-   **PhaseÂ 3 (2032--2035)** -- Expands coverage by lowering the size threshold as follows: buildings â‰¥15â€¯000Â ftÂ² (2032), â‰¥10â€¯000Â ftÂ² (2033) and â‰¥5â€¯000Â ftÂ² (2034). Emissions standards apply to nonâ€‘residential and residential buildings according to SectionÂ 5. Buildings below 5Â 000Â ftÂ² remain exempt.

-   **PhaseÂ 4 (2036--2040)** -- Applies emissions standards to all covered buildings; smaller buildings added in PhaseÂ 3 shall meet standards commensurate with their sector. All covered buildings must achieve **netâ€‘zero emissions byÂ 2040**.

3.2Â **Exemptions.** The following buildings are exempt from this ordinance: (a) municipal, state or federal facilities; (b) buildings scheduled for demolition within 12Â months; (c) facilities with emergency power functions where compliance would compromise public safety; (d) buildings granted a hardship compliance plan (SectionÂ 6.5).

## SectionÂ 4Â -- Reporting Requirements

4.1Â **Annual reporting.** Covered buildings shall annually report wholeâ€‘building energy use, water use (optional) and greenhouseâ€‘gas emissions using the EPA's **ENERGYÂ STAR Portfolio Manager** or successor platform. Reports shall be submitted by MayÂ 1 of the following year.

4.2Â **Electricity emissions.** During PhaseÂ 1 and PhaseÂ 2, electricity consumption shall be reported but **excluded from emissions compliance calculations**, consistent with Newton's approach[\[4\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=PEX%20vendor%20notes%20%E2%80%A2%20Newton,whole%20building%20all%20at%20once). The Town may incorporate electricity emissions into standards in PhaseÂ 3 or PhaseÂ 4 through regulation, following consultation with the Brookline Emissions Review Board.

4.3Â **Baseline.** Each covered building shall establish a baseline emissions value by averaging two consecutive calendar years between 2018--2024. Owners may select baseline years to capture prior efficiency investments. Baseline data must be thirdâ€‘party verified.

4.4Â **Data disclosure.** Aggregated building performance data, compliance status and investment fund distributions shall be published annually by the Town, protecting confidential business information where required.

4.5Â **Verification.** Covered buildings shall obtain thirdâ€‘party verification of reported data in **verification years**, which occur every five years beginning with **2026**. The Town shall accredit qualified verifiers and maintain a public list of eligible professionals.

## SectionÂ 5Â -- Emissions Standards and Timeline

5.1Â **General standard.** The Town shall establish emissions standards, expressed in kilograms of COâ‚‚e per square foot per year, for each building type (e.g., office, retail, laboratory, residential). Standards shall decrease progressively so that all covered buildings meet **netâ€‘zero emissions by 2040**. Standards shall be informed by benchmarking data and regional decarbonization pathways.

5.2Â **Accelerated track for large emitters.** **Nonâ€‘residential buildings â‰¥100â€¯000Â ftÂ²** shall meet emissions standards four years earlier than smaller buildings, reaching **netâ€‘zero by 2035**, mirroring Cambridge's accelerated schedule[\[2\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=%2A%20Non,to%20net%20zero%20by%202035).

5.3Â **Emissions factors.** The Town shall publish annual emissions factors for electricity, steam, chilled water and district energy, projected into future years. Factors shall reflect state and regional grid decarbonization trajectories.

5.4Â **Schedules.** The Town Administrator or designee shall promulgate a schedule of emissions standards and deadlines for each phase. Standards shall be adopted via regulation, following public hearing and review by the Brookline Emissions Review Board.

## SectionÂ 6Â -- Compliance Pathways

6.1Â **Direct compliance.** Building owners may meet emissions standards by reducing onâ€‘site fossilâ€‘fuel use and improving energy efficiency. Compliance may include electrification of heating systems, installation of heat pumps, envelope upgrades and demandâ€‘management measures.

6.2Â **Renewable energy procurement.** Owners may procure renewable electricity through powerâ€‘purchase agreements (PPAs), virtual PPAs, community solar subscriptions or renewable energy certificates certified by the New England grid operator. Credit shall be granted only for **bundled renewable energy** demonstrating additionality.

6.3Â **Portfolios.** Owners of multiple covered buildings may create a **portfolio** and meet an aggregated emissions target across the portfolio. Portfolios must demonstrate that benefits (e.g., retrofits, lower energy burdens) are prioritized for **EnvironmentalÂ Justice communities** and affordable housing.

6.4Â **Individual compliance schedules.** Owners may apply for an individual schedule that aligns emissions reductions with major capital cycles or building renovation timelines. Schedules must show a path to meeting the standard by the required deadline and be approved by the Brookline Emissions Review Board.

6.5Â **Hardship compliance plans.** Owners experiencing financial or technical hardship may apply for a hardship compliance plan. Applications must document constraints and propose interim measures. The Review Board may approve partial or temporary relief but must protect tenant rights and public health.

## SectionÂ 7Â -- Alternative Compliance and Investment Fund

7.1Â **Brookline EquitableÂ Emissions Investment Fund.** The Town hereby establishes a dedicated fund to support emissionsâ€‘reduction projects that benefit Brookline residents, with priority for **EnvironmentalÂ Justice populations** and **affordable housing**. The fund shall receive revenue from **AlternativeÂ Compliance Payments (ACP)**, administrative penalties, and any appropriations by Town Meeting. Money in the fund shall be used solely for building carbonâ€‘abatement projects, climate resilience improvements, workforce development, tenant support programmes and related administration, following the model of Boston's EquitableÂ Emissions Investment Fund[\[5\]](https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/equitable-emissions-investment-fund#:~:text=The%C2%A0Building%20Emissions%20Reduction%20and%20Disclosure,established%20to%20support%20this%20goal).

7.2Â **Alternative Compliance Payments.**

-   **Price.** The price of an ACP shall be set by regulation but shall not be less than **\$234 per metric ton of COâ‚‚e**, matching Boston and Cambridge's initial pricing[\[6\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Alternative%20Compliance%20Payments%3A%20are%20payments,234%2FmT%20for%202026%20to%202030). Prices may be indexed to inflation and may increase in later phases to incentivize direct reductions.
-   **Use of funds.** ACP revenue shall be deposited into the EquitableÂ Emissions Investment Fund and allocated by the Brookline Emissions Review Board (SectionÂ 8) through an open grant process. Projects must demonstrate public benefits and prioritize EJ populations. Projects eligible for funding may include electrification of affordable housing, energyâ€‘efficiency upgrades in EJ communities, workforce training for heating and cooling professionals, and resilience projects (e.g., cooling centres).

7.3Â **VerifiedÂ Carbon Credits (VCCs).**

Owners may use a limited quantity of VCCs to offset emissions, subject to strict criteria: (a) only offsets from projects within New England or approved jurisdictions; (b) offsets must meet rigorous additionality and verifiability standards; (c) allowable offset percentage shall decline over time (e.g., 10Â % in PhaseÂ 2, 5Â % in PhaseÂ 3, 0Â % in PhaseÂ 4), following Cambridge's declining caps[\[7\]](https://www.cambridgema.gov/sustainable/BEUDO#:~:text=Verified%20Carbon%20Credits%3A%20Starting%20in,site%20thermal%20energy%20emissions).

7.4Â **Deferrals.** Owners may apply for a deferral of up to five years when compliance is infeasible due to construction projects, major capital upgrades or grid constraints. Deferral applications must include a detailed plan and schedule and are subject to approval by the Review Board.

## SectionÂ 8Â -- Governance and Administration

8.1Â **Brookline Emissions Review Board.** The Town shall create a **Review Board** comprising **nine members** appointed by the Select Board with representation from: (a) environmental justice or communityâ€‘based organisations; (b) affordable housing organisations; (c) building science/engineering experts; (d) energy policy experts; (e) realâ€‘estate or buildingâ€‘owner representatives; (f) tenant or renter advocates; and (g) one member designated by Town Meeting. Members shall serve staggered threeâ€‘year terms.

8.2Â **Responsibilities.** The Review Board shall: \* Evaluate compliance submissions, individual compliance schedules and hardship plans. \* Set rules and procedures for the EquitableÂ Emissions Investment Fund; review and approve grant applications. \* Recommend emissions standards and ACP pricing to the Town Administrator. \* Oversee verification protocols and maintain a list of accredited verifiers. \* Produce an annual report on programme performance, compliance rates, emissions reductions and fund allocations, to be presented to the Select Board and Town Meeting.

8.3Â **Staffing.** The Town shall hire a **BERDO Program Manager**, data analysts, equity programme managers and community outreach staff as outlined in the Brookline BERDO plan. Staffing and administrative costs may be supported by ACP revenue.

## SectionÂ 9Â -- Equity and Tenant Protections

9.1Â **Equitable portfolios and plans.** All portfolio and compliance plan submissions must demonstrate how benefits (bill savings, indoor air quality, comfort and resilience) will be distributed to **EnvironmentalÂ Justice** communities and **deedâ€‘restricted affordable housing**. Plans must avoid displacing tenants and should include tenant engagement and protections.

9.2Â **Prohibition on unjust cost passâ€‘throughs.** Building owners may not increase rents or fees to recoup ACPs or penalties beyond what is permitted under applicable law. The Review Board may investigate complaints of unlawful cost passâ€‘throughs.

9.3Â **Funding for tenant assistance.** A portion of the EquitableÂ Emissions InvestmentÂ Fund shall be reserved for tenant assistance programmes, including utility bill assistance, retrofits in lowâ€‘income housing, and legal support for tenants facing eviction or displacement related to building upgrades.

## SectionÂ 10Â -- Enforcement and Penalties

10.1Â **Violations.** Violations include (a) failure to submit required reports; (b) submission of false or incomplete data; (c) failure to comply with emissions standards; (d) failure to implement approved compliance schedules; and (e) failure to submit ACPs or comply with conditions of a hardship or deferral plan.

10.2Â **Penalty structure.** The Town shall adopt a schedule of penalties. Penalties shall be progressive, starting with warnings and cure periods for firstâ€‘time reporting violations and escalating to daily fines for continued noncompliance. Penalties collected under this section shall be deposited into the EquitableÂ Emissions InvestmentÂ Fund.

10.3Â **Grace period.** Penalties for exceeding emissions standards shall not be assessed until the standard has been in effect for **three years**, consistent with Newton's approach[\[8\]](https://www.nationalgridus.com/media/pdfs/ma/project-expediter-program/2024-september-pex-meeting.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Scope%3A%20Includes%20direct%20emissions,year%203%20of%20emission%20standards). During the grace period, owners must demonstrate goodâ€‘faith efforts to comply and may be required to submit corrective action plans.

## SectionÂ 11Â -- Rulemaking and Amendments

11.1Â The Town Administrator, in consultation with the Brookline Emissions Review Board, shall promulgate regulations to implement this ordinance. Regulations may specify emissions standards by building type, emissions factors, calculation methodologies, verification protocols, ACP pricing, VCC criteria, and procedures for deferrals and hardship plans.

11.2Â The Select Board may propose amendments to expand or modify the ordinance, including lowering squareâ€‘footage thresholds, adjusting timelines, or incorporating electricity emissions into compliance calculations. Amendments shall require approval by Town Meeting.

## SectionÂ 12Â -- Severability

If any section, subsection or provision of this ordinance is determined to be invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
