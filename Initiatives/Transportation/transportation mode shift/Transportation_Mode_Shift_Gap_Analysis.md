## 9. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS

### Critical Actions for Comprehensive Mode Shift:

1. **Immediate** (0-6 months):
   - Align with state climate targets and policies
   - Establish baseline metrics and data collection (learn from Boston's VMT tracking)
   - Apply for available grant funding
   - Create equity assessment framework
   - **NEW**: Initiate regional coordination meetings with Boston, Cambridge, Newton

2. **Short-term** (6-18 months):
   - Develop comprehensive mode shift plan with specific mode share targets
   - Launch pilot projects for quick wins (adopt Somerville's quick-build methodology)
   - Establish regional partnerships for Blue Bikes expansion and charging coordination
   - Create public engagement structure
   - **NEW**: Develop Transportation Safety Ordinance with measurable targets

3. **Medium-term** (18-36 months):
   - Implement Complete Streets redesigns with protected bike infrastructure
   - Launch TOD initiatives leveraging Green Line connectivity
   - Deploy technology solutions and integrated payment systems
   - Scale successful pilots
   - **NEW**: Establish regional mobility hubs and cross-border route connections

### Key Success Factors Enhanced by Regional Analysis:
- **Political leadership and commitment** with ordinance-based accountability (Cambridge model)
- **Dedicated funding streams** leveraging regional partnerships and state programs
- **Community engagement and buy-in** using school safety as unifying priority (regional approach)
- **Regional coordination** as central strategy rather than afterthought
- **Performance measurement and adaptation** with shared regional metrics
- **Equity-centered implementation** coordinated across municipal boundaries

### Regional Competitive Advantages for Brookline:
- **Green Line connectivity**: Unique subway access throughout community
- **Strategic location**: Central hub between major employment centers
- **Density foundation**: Higher density than suburban peers enables efficient transit
- **Educational institutions**: Multiple schools create safe routes priority

### Critical Findings from Regional Comparison:
The regional analysis reveals that Brookline is **significantly behind** neighboring communities in transportation mode shift planning. While Boston targets 50% car trip reduction by 2030, Cambridge has mandated 25 miles of protected bike lanes, and Newton has institutional frameworks for implementation, Brookline's current vision lacks:

1. **Quantified mode shift targets** (all neighbors have specific goals)
2. **Legislative framework** for accountability (Cambridge ordinance model)
3. **Regional coordination strategy** (Boston's comprehensive planning)
4. **Rapid implementation methodology** (Somerville's quick-build approach)
5. **Institutional structure** (Newton's taskforce model)

The current vision provides a solid foundation for vehicle electrification but requires **urgent expansion** to achieve transformative mode shift aligned with regional leadership, state climate goals, and transportation best practices. Without regional coordination and ambitious mode shift targets, Brookline risks becoming a transportation island in an increasingly connected sustainable transportation network.
