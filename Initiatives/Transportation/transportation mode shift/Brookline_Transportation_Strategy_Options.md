# Brookline Transportation Mode Shift Strategy Options
## Scalable Approaches from Current Vision to Regional Leadership

### Overview
This document presents four escalating strategy options for Brookline's transportation transformation, building from the current electrification-focused vision to comprehensive regional leadership. Each strategy incorporates lessons from neighboring municipalities while considering political feasibility, resource requirements, and community impact.

**Updated to reflect Brookline's significant progress as of 2024-2025.**

### BROOKLINE'S CURRENT FOUNDATION (2024-2025)
#### ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments Already in Place:
- **Climate Framework**: ZEAB reconstituted with 2040 net-zero mandate and environmental justice focus
- **Policy Foundation**: Complete Streets policy adopted, fossil fuel-free building regulations implemented
- **EV Infrastructure**: Federal grant secured for curbside charging, Soule Recreation Center and Skyline Park charging stations in final deployment
- **Major Project**: Washington Street redesign approved with protected bike lanes (Fall 2027 construction)
- **Planning Process**: 2025 Climate Action and Resiliency Plan under development with extensive public engagement
- **Community Engagement**: Electrify Brookline campaign active, 600+ residents participated in CARP planning

This strong foundation means Brookline is already well into Strategy 1 implementation and has made significant progress toward Strategy 2 and 3 elements.
