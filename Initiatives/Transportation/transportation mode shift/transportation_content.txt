Transportation Mode Shift

  Reduce then eliminate internal combustion engine (ICE)-based
  transportation. Electrify personal, municipal and public transit

Personal: Fewer cars, all electric.

-   Fewer cars:

    -   Invest in and promote alternatives (walking, biking, scooters,
          other micromobility). Plan and implement dedicated, protected
          travel lanes. Strengthen Non-Car solutions in South Brookline.
          Safe routes to school.

    -   Consider whether public e-bike and e-scooter charging may be
          helpful.

-   The remainder all electric:

    -   Continue to build out publicly-available charging network.

        -   Town-owned lots

        -   Curbside

        -   Other shared solutions? (ItsElectric?)

    -   Promote to property owners who are able to provide their own
          charging solution (single family homes with off-street
          parking, etc). Advantages to starting small and building up
          from there.

        -   120v trickle charge (public chargers to provide fast charge
              when needed)

        -   240v intermediate level (NEMA 14-50 40A)

        -   Level 2 home charging

    -   Privately-owned multi-unit condo or apartment buildings where
          car owner can't directly control or access charging solution

        -   Identify a few different scenarios, plan to work with condo
              association or landlord

    -   Town-owned multi-unit properties (BHA most notably)

        -   Start effective planning for on-site charging solutions

Municipal

-   Electrify town fleet, police.

    -   Any lessons learned from the 2 electric vehicles in the police
          fleet?

        -   One Mustang - special events vehicle. One Ford F250 - animal
              control

        -   Per conversation at Brookline Day, they work for special
              purposes but EV not ready for line vehicles, which
              basically run 24/7 and canâ€™t afford downtime for charging.

    -   Street sweepers, grounds maintenance equipment.

-   Plan eventual replacement of larger ICE equipment (fire, town-owned
      garbage, etc.)

    -   Keep an eye on fuel cell technology for large vehicles.

Transit

-   Subway already there

-   MBTA buses beyond Brookline's reach

-   Town-owned shuttles (Senior van. Other?)

-   Encourage taxis and ride shares to use available chargers
      (apparently the original premise for the Webster Street L3
      chargers)
